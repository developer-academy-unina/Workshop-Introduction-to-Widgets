## About

The well-known and amazing iOS Home Screen experience remained almost unchanged from the  first version of iOS until the Worldwide Developer Conference 2020, when Apple, with the announcement of iOS 14, revolutionised and enhanced it introducing Widgets.

Widgets are the best way to bring your Apps’ most useful information directly to the Home Screen or Today’s View on the iOS and iPadOS and also on macOS Notification Center.

Along with Widgets, Apple introduced also a new framework to implement them: WidgetKit.
Thanks to WidgetKit and SwiftUI, developers can easily build Widgets and make them available across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to provide a new dynamic and personalised experience for the Users and to make your app stand out and get noticed.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Workshop-Introduction-to-Widgets
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

This Workshop will make you understand WidgetKit features and functionality, you will discover how to create a Widget project, configure the Widget and its provider, and start exploring timeline concepts by creating a real Widget from start to finish during the activity. The Moon App is an assets tracker app that will be used as starting point to create the Widget during the activity.
